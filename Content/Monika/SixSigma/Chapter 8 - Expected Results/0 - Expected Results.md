## Expected Results

We made no hypotheses as to the outcome of the study, as by design we follow a data-driven approach that is very much akin to a grounded theory study. It would be wrong, at that point, to assume any outcomes, but we can derive some results from our pilot study. What we do expect is to get a much better understanding of the inner workings of intrapreneurship programs, which is a significant theoretical contributions that we want to make.

We also expect to confirm the theory upon which we are based, i.e., the IEPL, GPM and CEAI instruments. These have been used for a number of studies, and we expect these instruments to work on our context.

We expect that we can predict, on the level of candidate and proposal screening, the probability of success for a given candidate and team. The underlying methods have, to our knowledge, not been applied to the area of Intrapreneurship; this is a significant methodological contribution we intend to make.

On the practical side, we expect to make available to the business practitioner a method to conduct agreement-finding sessions in a much more efficient way, using a simplified Delphi Method that we intend to develop and contribute to practice.
