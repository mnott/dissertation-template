### * Research Focus

This research delves into the intricacies of Six Sigma methodologies applied to Tenant Data Cleanup and Optimization. While there is a wealth of research on the implementation and outcomes of Six Sigma in various industries, there is a noticeable gap in studies focusing on its application in tenant data management. Specifically, no research has systematically, longitudinally, and both quantitatively and qualitatively examined how Six Sigma can help a project aimed at tenant data optimization.

Chapter [[0 - Literature Review|Literature Review]] reviews the literature establishing this gap in prior research.

This research aims to fill this gap by posing the following research question:
