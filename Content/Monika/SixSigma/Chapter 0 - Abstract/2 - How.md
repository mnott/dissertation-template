### * Research Approach

We propose a Six Sigma study based on data accumulated over a longitudinal analysis spanning over a period of three years, monitoring several cycles of tenant data cleanup. The study will employ both quantitative data analysis techniques, including machine learning algorithms for structured and unstructured data, and qualitative data analysis methods such as expert interviews and Delphi panels with account executives and sales support teams.

The research will interact with the Six Sigma project at three key points:

1. During the Define phase, the pilot study will be utilized to identify the most critical data inconsistencies.
2. During the Measure and Analyze phases, machine learning-based natural language processing will be used to categorize and prioritize feedback from sales support, then a qualitative data analysis will based to evaluate the feedback collected.
3. During the Control phase, expert interviews using the Delphi method will be conducted with data analysts and sales support teams to validate the initial classifiers and findings.
