### Methodological Aims

Methodologically, the research will leverage the three years of quantitative data analysis as a pilot study to validate the Six Sigma approaches for tenant data cleanup. Traditional data cleanup has often been qualitative, relying on manual checks and heuristic methods. The advent of machine learning and data analytics offers new avenues for quantitative evaluation. This research aims to develop and validate machine learning algorithms tailored for tenant data cleanup, thereby providing a quantitative justification for the application of Six Sigma methodologies in this context.
