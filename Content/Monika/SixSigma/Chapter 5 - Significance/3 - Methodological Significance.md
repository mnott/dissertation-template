### Methodological Significance

In tenant cleanup programs, the assessment and prioritization of tasks can be complex and prone to errors. Machine learning can not only reduce the workload but also enhance the reproducibility of the decision-making process. While machine learning can establish correlation but not causality, it can flag discrepancies between automated choices and human decisions.

A pilot study has shown that simple machine learning methods like k-Nearest Neighbors can effectively differentiate between effective and less effective cleanup methods based on an analysis of unstructured text, such as field reports or tenant feedback.
