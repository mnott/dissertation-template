### Theoretical Significance



Organizations that believe their tenant cleanup programs are already efficient should be particularly interested in this research. The study will compare two scenarios:

```

In particular companies making this claim should be very interested in this research. To establish the significance of this research from a theoretical perspective, we are going to compare two scenarios (see Exhibit [r#exhibit:Impact-of-Errors]):

- *High Program Efficiency:* In this scenario, the program excels at task prioritization and method optimization. The opportunity costs of not adopting more effective solutions are high, and the marginal costs of implementing new methods decline significantly. The opportunity costs of missing out on effective solutions are high, and the marginal costs decline significantly. Exhibit [r#exhibit:Impact-of-Errors] shows this scenario as a set of dotted lines: Since the program is efficient at improving the quality of the tenant processes, the opportunity costs of missing out on one of these processes are comparatively high; and since the program is efficient at selecting tenants, the marginal cost of one idea declines strongly. ```\bigskip```
- *Low Program Efficiency:* Represented as continuous lines, in this scenario, the program is less efficient at selecting tenants and at improving the quality of data. As a result, the marginal costs of the program decline less sharply, and likewise, because any given tenant might be missed out by the program, the opportunity costs of missing out one of those tenants are lower.

The research is more significant for programs with higher efficiency, as the cost of errors in such programs is greater.
