### Practical Significance

The research will employ a longitudinal Delphi study to identify the most effective aspects of tenant cleanup programs. The Delphi method involves experts ranking various characteristics based on their perceived contribution to effective tenant cleanup. These rankings are then analyzed to calculate "Kendall‚Äôs ùëä," a measure of expert agreement.

The challenge with this approach is that the underlying mathematics---see equation [er#eqn:w1] on page [pr#eqn:w1]---does not easily lend itself to the business user: Because of the complexity involved, Delphi studies are typically not executed to find agreement as part of project settings. As this study will show, by rewriting the mathematics behind Delphi, the method can be made easily accessible to the business user, and thus improve the decision making processes.
