## Significance


This chapter outlines the significance of the research in the context of tenant cleanup, focusing on three key areas: theory, methodology, and practical application. The research aims to make the following contributions:

\begin{bulletpoint}[1][t]
```
*To Theory*: Develop a theoretical framework to optimize the cost-efficiency of tenant cleanup programs. This will help organizations run these programs more effectively, thereby lowering the total cost, which includes both the marginal costs of implementing new cleanup methods and the opportunity costs of not adopting more effective solutions.

```

```latex
\begin{bulletpoint}[2][t]
```
*To Methodology*: Utilize machine learning to enhance the assessment and prioritization of different cleanup tasks, as well as to improve the evaluation of unstructured data like field reports and tenant feedback.
```latex
\end{bulletpoint}
```

```latex
\begin{bulletpoint}[3][t]
```
*To Practice*: Implement Delphi panels efficiently to expedite decision-making, thereby reducing the time and resources spent on less effective cleanup methods.

```

Given the potential vagueness of claiming significance at this level, this research proposal will present a formal model for cost estimates, demonstrate the value of machine learning in decision-making, and outline how the Delphi method can be made more accessible.
