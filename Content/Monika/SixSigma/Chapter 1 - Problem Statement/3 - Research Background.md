### Research Background


A comprehensive analysis of tenant data spanning three years serves as the pilot study for this research. The study employed statistical and machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and anomalies in tenant data. While the algorithms were effective in flagging inconsistencies, their application was limited to the data available, emphasizing the need for a more structured approach.

The findings from this three-year analysis, coupled with the absence of Six Sigma applications in tenant data cleanup, have led to a reorientation of the research question. The focus has shifted from merely identifying data inconsistencies to also include the structured application of Six Sigma methodologies for both data quality improvement and process efficiency.
