## Problem Statement

### Research Problem

As elaborated in [[0 - Literature Review|Literature Review]], Six Sigma methodologies have been a cornerstone in quality management and process improvement since their inception in the 1980s by Motorola. While these methodologies have been widely applied in manufacturing, healthcare, and service industries, their application in the realm of tenant data management and cleanup is virtually unexplored.

This research aims to fill this gap by focusing on the efficiency and effectiveness of applying Six Sigma methodologies to tenant data cleanup. Organizations often invest in data management solutions without a comprehensive understanding of the intricacies involved in data cleanup. This research will provide a framework for applying Six Sigma methodologies to this specific domain, thereby offering organizations a more informed approach to tenant data management.
