On the individual level, there are four measures to assess the individual's propensity to act as an intrapreneur ([[@Chan-2017aa]]):

- *Intrapreneurial Motivation:* Reflecting the individual's interest and motivation to take part in intrapreneurial and innovative engagements within their organization
- *Entrepreneurial Motivation:* Aspiration of the individual's readiness to value, and engage in, entrepreneurial activities outside their organization
- *Professional Motivation:* Reflecting the individual's motivation to, and valuation of, professional advancement
