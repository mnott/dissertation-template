##### Program Level

On the program level, there are five measures to assess the antecedents of Organizational Entrepreneurship ([[@Kuratko-2014aa]]):

- *Top Management Support:* The extent to which top managers are perceived to support and promote entrepreneurial behavior
- *Work Discretion:* The extent to which the organization is perceived to tolerate failure and delegate authority and responsibility to lower levels
- *Rewards and Reinforcement:* The extent to which the organization is perceived to provide for systems rewarding entrepreneurial activity and encouraging risk taking and innovation
- *Time Availability:* The individual's perception of their work schedule allowing for extra time to pursue innovative activities
- *Organizational Boundaries:* The extend to which the boundaries within an organization are perceived to be flexible, allowing for a flow of information within the organization, as well as across the boundaries of the firm ([[@Coase-1937fk]])
