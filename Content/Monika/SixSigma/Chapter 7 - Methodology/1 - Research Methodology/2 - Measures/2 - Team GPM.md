##### Team Level

On the level of the team, there are five measures to assess the team performance ([[@Cammann-1983aa]](c); [[@Kickul-2001aa]](c))

- *Group Homogeneity:* Measures the similarity of the group members with regards to characteristics such as background and experience 
- *Group Goal Clarity:* The understanding that the team member has of the group's goals
- *Group Cohesiveness:* Measures the social characteristics of the group and how attractive the membership in a group is to people outside the group
- *Open Group Process:* Measures the level of satisfaction a team member gets from his involvement, which results in a reduction of conflicts
- *Internal Fragmentation:* Measures the degree of group conflict as well as the inter-personal relationship within the group
