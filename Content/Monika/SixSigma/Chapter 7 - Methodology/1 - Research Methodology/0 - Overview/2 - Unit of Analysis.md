#### Units of Analysis


##### The Individual
The research question calls for a method to identify the most promising candidates, i.e., it's first unit of analysis is the candidate herself. At this level, we intend to use [[@Chan-2017aa]](a)'s [[@Chan-2017aa]](yp) Intrapreneurial, Entrepreneurial, Professional, and Leadership (IEPL) motivation scale to identify promising team members and assess their personality. 


##### The Team
The candidates form a winning team, so that their personalities are mediated by the inner workings of the team. The unit of analysis here becomes the team, and we intend to use [[@Kickul-2001aa]](a)'s [a#Kickul:2001aa]'s [[@Kickul-2001aa]](yp) Group-Performance-Model (GPM) to assess the mediating effect of the characteristics of Group Homogeneity, Group Goal Clarity, Group Cohesiveness, Open Group Process and Internal Fragmentation.


##### The Program
The groups are supported by the intrapreneurship program. On this level, the unit of analysis is therefore the program itself, and we intend to use [[@Kuratko-2014aa]](a)'s [[@Kuratko-2014aa]](yp) Corporate Entrepreneurship Assessment Instrument (CEAI) to assess the mediating effect of the program.
