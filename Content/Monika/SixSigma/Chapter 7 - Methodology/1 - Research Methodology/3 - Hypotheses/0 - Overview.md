#### Hypotheses

In the theoretical framework (see Exhibit  [vr#exhibit:Theoretical-Framework]), every team member brings into the group, and hence the program, his own personality and experience. Acting together as one team, the group must perform successfuly to be selected by the program. The group dynamic thus mediates the individual performances of the team members, and likewise, as the group is embedded within the organization's intrapreneurship program, the characteristics of that organization mediate the final outcome.

While the first part of the research question deals with operationalizing the identification of the most promising team members, the second part concerns the program's support to drive their idea to success. Within that process, what is the relationship between the individual personality, the group characteristics, and those of the organization? This section looks at the influencing factors derived from the literature and draws hypotheses.
