### Research Philosophy

This author takes the stance of a *Depth Realist*. This means that compared to a shallow realist stance, we go yet a bit further in actually formally defining structural layers of reality: what can be empirically observed, what actually exists, and what really happens but cannot be readily observed. This gives depth to reality (hence the name), and allows to extend the view to dynamic processes. On the epistemological side, this corresponds to a Neo-Realist stance, where the knowledge of the underlying causes for the observable mechanisms are derived from the mechanisms that produce them (and which cannot be observed). This knowledge is formulated by conceptualizing underlying entities, or mechanisms, which can now be congruent with one another, but which can also compete; while this appears to be complicated, it becomes very clear thinking about, for example, a multilinear regression: Each of its factors can have his own influence on a given outcome, and the direction of that influence on the level of the outcome can be positive or negative. With more than one independent variables, these influences can either reinforce one another, or they can cancel out. It is by measuring these influences and generating models about them that we create knowledge about the underlying structure of reality and hence make proposals for, or assumptions of, what really happens. Without going too much into detail, correspondingly, in Machine Learning terminology, the layered approach of the Depth-Realist ontology is very much congruent with the concepts of hidden layers in a neural network, a kernel function in the context of support vector machines, or more generally the concept of a model in machine learning.
