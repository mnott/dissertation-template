## Literature Review

### Overview

This chapter provides a comprehensive review of the literature related to the research proposal, focusing on Six Sigma methodologies applied to tenant cleanup programs. Initially, we delve into the theoretical background of Six Sigma in the context of tenant cleanup (section [vr#Theoretical Background])). This helps us identify gaps in existing literature that this research aims to fill. Subsequently, we explore the state-of-the-art methodological approaches, particularly those involving machine learning and data analytics (section  [vr#Methodological Background]).


### Theoretical Background


The concept of Six Sigma has been extensively studied since its inception in the 1980s by Motorola. Six Sigma methodologies have been applied across various sectors, from manufacturing to service industries, to improve process efficiency and reduce defects (Harry & Schroeder, 2000). However, there is a noticeable gap in the literature when it comes to applying Six Sigma methodologies specifically to tenant cleanup programs.

Studies like those by Antony et al. (2007) have explored the application of Six Sigma in environmental management but have not focused on tenant cleanup. This research aims to bridge this gap by applying Six Sigma principles to optimize tenant cleanup programs.



### Methodological Background

While Six Sigma methodologies have been well-documented, the integration of machine learning techniques to enhance these methodologies is relatively new. Traditional Six Sigma relies heavily on statistical tools like control charts, process mapping, and root cause analysis (Pyzdek & Keller, 2018). However, the advent of machine learning offers new avenues for data analysis and predictive modeling.

In the broader context of process improvement, machine learning algorithms such as k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN; Altman, 1992), Support Vector Machines (SVM; Cortes & Vapnik, 1995), and Decision Trees (Quinlan, 1986) have been employed. These algorithms have been effective in classifying and predicting outcomes based on both structured and unstructured data (Witten et al., 2016).

Recent research by Smith and Johnson (2020) has shown the effectiveness of machine learning in predicting the success of environmental cleanup projects. However, these methodologies have not been specifically applied to tenant cleanup programs, representing a gap this research aims to fill.

For binary classification problems, such as determining the effectiveness of a particular cleanup method, SVM has been shown to have high predictability (Chang & Lin, 2011). Logistic Regression (LR) models also offer good predictive capabilities but may suffer from overfitting (Hosmer Jr et al., 2013). Bayesian Networks (BN; Koller & Friedman, 2009) have the added advantage of handling missing data and avoiding overfitting but are based on the assumption of independence among predictor variables.

In summary, while machine learning techniques have been applied in various domains for process improvement and predictive analytics, their application in tenant cleanup programs using Six Sigma methodologies remains an area ripe for exploration.
