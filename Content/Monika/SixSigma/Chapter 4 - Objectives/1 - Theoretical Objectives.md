*Initial Six Sigma Assessment:* At the start of each project, utilize Six Sigma's DMAIC (Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control) framework to establish key performance indicators (KPIs) for tenant cleanup ([[@Harmony-Living-2018aa]]).

```

\begin{bulletpoint}[1b]
```
*Post-Project Evaluation:* At the end of each project, use Six Sigma tools such as Control Charts and Pareto Analysis to evaluate the efficiency and effectiveness of the cleanup process. This will also involve assessing waste management and environmental impact ([[@Sony-2020aa]]).
