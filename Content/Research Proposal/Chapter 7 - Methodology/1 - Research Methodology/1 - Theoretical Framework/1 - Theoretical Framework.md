#### Theoretical Framework
Based on the units of analysis mentioned in the previous section, we are planning to use three analytical frameworks in order to assess each unit of analysis, and to bring them together into one single framework as shown in Exhibit  [vr#exhibit:Theoretical-Framework].

The following sections will elaborate on the individual measures, and draft hypotheses about their influence on the outcome, i.e., whether a team made it to the final round of contenders and eventually won the program.
